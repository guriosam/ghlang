We definitely do care about byte-shaving :)\n\n> Perhaps this should have been tagged v0.1.0 instead of v1.0.0?\n\nNope! We're following npm's more recent semver recommendations, which suggest starting with 1.0.0 and iterating on that baseline rather than opting for the more classic 0.x.y model. We're new to it too, so still working out how well that model works.\n"

I've learned to look into the issues to see if something is truly ready to go for consumption (or in my case [CDN hosting](http://www.jsdelivr.com/)), but most others will see v1.0.0 & immediately start using.\n\n> following npm's more recent semver recommendations\n\nYes, I watched [that thread also](https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues/221#issue-41992376).  I do think people are too afraid to bump up to 1.0.0.  But I think v1.0.0 should be 'ready to consume'.  Perhaps I'm too much of a perf nerd, but even you agree there needs to be more steps to be truly ready.  I would have released as v0.6.0; \"We're more than half-way there\".\n"

It is what I & 1/3 of app devs plan to do.\n\nSuggestions:\nIt would be more clear to call PNGs `-png` & not `-web`.  [SVG browser support](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) is ~90%.  (Plus IMHO SVGs, single-file or complied into a sprite sheet, are superior for 'web' than PNGs & icon fonts.\nI think it wold be rare to need all resolutions of PNGs & SVGs, so would be better to further break down the file groups?  eg:\n- material-design-icons-png-ios-24dp\n- material-design-icons-png-web-xxxhdpi\n- material-design-icons-svg-48px\n"

I'll skip over any icon which is anything other than pubic domain, because frankly I could draw the icon myself in 15 minutes. I would _rather_ do that than comply with (or figure how to comply with) sharealike _or_ attribution.\n\nI guess it's a tricky one because collectively the icons represent a lot of work, but ...well that's my perspective having often _used_ icons for things\n"
